            "changelog": "1.4.2\\n\\nThis is a stable maintenance release. It features some bugfixes, optimizations, and other improvements backported from the v1.5 development tree.\\n\\nReworked gamepad input handling and configuration:\\nThe free/restricted axis distinction is gone; the joystick always operates in \"free\" mode.\\nAdded direction snapping functionality to help aid exact movement in cardinal and/or diagonal directions. The snapping angle can be adjusted from 0% (disabled) to 100% (similar to the old \"restricted\" mode). The snapping angle can also be biased towards cardinals or diagonals.\\nWhen the maximum zone is less than or equals dead zone, moving the character will always move at maximum speed (as in the old \"restricted\" mode).\\nMost of these settings are now visualized in the options menu and can be tested there.\\nChanged the default Spell Card (Bomb) and Power Surage gamepad bindings to Left Trigger and Right Trigger respectively.\\nIf autorestart is enabled for spell practice, it will now try to load a quicksave if one exists.\\nAdded a \"load quicksave\" option to the pause menu in practice modes.\\nCutscenes that have been seen before can now be completely skipped.\\nAdded an option to reset the config to last saved values.\\nReduced some sprite batching CPU overhead.\\nOptimized rendering of scenes with many lasers.\\nOptimized loading of webp files.\\nOptimized various math routines.\\nImproved performance of some shaders.\\nDue to bad OpenGL drivers, macOS releases now use ANGLE for rendering by default. This fixes serious performance issues on some Apple systems.\\nWorked around broken rendering in WebGL on Apple systems with certain versions of ANGLE (see #386). The ANGLE bug has been fixed upstream, but certain systems are known to still be affected, such as iOS 18.\\nFixed crashes related to opening the pause menu.\\nFixed the cutscene text spontaneously disappearing on some systems.\\nFixed laser rendering errors during screen-shake effects.\\nFixed some minor general rendering errors.\\nFixed rendering errors specific to WebGL and ANGLE on Windows.\\nFixed ongoing asynchronous tasks (e.g. screenshot encoding) sometimes failing to finish when exiting the game.\\nFixed some erroneous build warnings when building with Clang 18+.\\nFixed pseudo-random lookup order when a resource exists in multiple locations. This allows files placed in sub-packages to override those from 00-taisei.zip reliably.\\nRemoved the defunct gles20 renderer backend.\\nScreenshots now use asynchronous GPU downloads.\\nAdded --width and --height command line parameters.\\nThe default config can now be customized by adding a config.default file to the game's resources.\\nAdded documentation for previously undocumented environment variables to ENVIRON.rst.\\nAdded an experimental \"framedump\" mode that can be used to render videos; see ENVIRON.rst for details.\\nAdded a watchdog in kiosk mode that resets the game to the main menu and default settings after a period of inactivity.\\nAdded the TAISEI_KIOSK_PREVENT_QUIT environment variable to control whether Quit is available in kiosk mode.\\nAdded a some basic test programs for the renderer API.\\n\\n1.4.1\\n\\nThis is a stable maintenance release. It features some bugfixes and optimizations backported from the v1.5 development tree.\\n\\nFixed a crash that happened after a few minutes would pass without any input if the intro cutscene had previously played (#371).\\nFixed a crash when attempting to start a stage on OpenBSD systems (#372).\\nFixed heavy audio distortion on the Switch (#374).\\nThis was a matter of updating the SDK, and entailed no code changes on Taisei's side.\\nOn the Switch the resolution will now automatically adapt to the console's docked/undocked state.\\nThreaded loading is now enabled on the Switch.\\nOptimized a few hot paths in the game update loop.\\nOptimized the tree branch mesh in the Stage 2 background to avoid rendering a lot of tiny triangles.\\nWorked around a Meson issue that broke Emscripten builds (42a7e49).\\nEnabled some \"modern\" WASM features for the Emscripten build. This raises the browser version requirements for the official build to Chromium 91 or Firefox 89.\\nAdded a gamemode build option to control whether to enable GameMode integration on Linux.\\n\\n1.4\\n\\nThis is a major release, with substantially redesigned stages and bosses, new story, new backgrounds, and heavy internal rewrites.\\n\\n1.3.2\\n\\nThis is a stable maintenance release. It features various bugfixes, optimizations, and minor features backported from the v1.4 development tree.\\n\\nThere are no gameplay changes and this version should be replay-compatible with the initial v1.3 release.\\n\\n1.3.1\\n\\nSilent update : recompiled with latest libnx\\n\\nThis is a stable maintenance release. It features some important bugfixes and a few optimizations and visual improvements backported from the v1.4 development tree, as well as new character art by @afensorm.\\n\\nOther than fixing some rare game-breaking bugs, there are no gameplay changes and this version should be replay-compatible with the initial v1.3 release.\\n\\nSemi-official homebrew Switch binaries are now also available, thanks to @p-sam's porting efforts.
